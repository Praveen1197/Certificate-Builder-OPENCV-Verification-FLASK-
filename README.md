# Certificate-Builder-OPENCV-Verification-FLASK-
This project is all about our(my friends) one of iniciative to teach students on onilne during COVIS-10 pendemic, 
So, I am Java Trainer and Graphic Designer in codeItDown( online platform to teach students online for free). 

So waht i have done is using First i have creted one certficate templateusing Photoshop then using OPENCV( python library) to extract all the data from excel sheet file print the student name and randomly genrated document Id in each certificate.  

For verification of the certificate, i have developed the Python Flask Web App to verify the document ID. It uses simple HTNL and CSS.

I have hosted my web app on http://codeitdown.pythonanywhere.com/verify/1A16ITI6JB ( this is just showing web app).
This is one of the document Id. If you enter any wrong Id which is not stored in database then it will redirect the another page.
